    "description": "Many tech leaders get the job by default. Theyâ€™re the best or most senior technologist and suddenly find themselves leading meetings, negotiating for resources, making strategic decisions their bosses donâ€™t understand and canâ€™t help with, participating in hiring, and a whole range of other mission-critical activities that fall outside of the technical toolbox. This meetup is for tech leads, managers, and directors of technical teams to get together a few times a year to learn, share, and have some fun. Sign up, letâ€™s meet up, and weâ€™ll find ways to help each other become better leaders. Look for morning and evening meetups, as well as special events a few times each year."
